Solution And Assumptions :-

Solution :-

Refer CustomMap.Java

Assumptions -
 - No null Key And Values
 - Simple random number for generating different files
 - Parametrized constructor to specify limit
  i.e as per  example if limit is 2 then map will write 3rd and 4th etc elements to file
 - only get and put method Overriden
 - Extended treemap for same time complexity of functions. but io read takes time
 - Normal locking on whole method no segmentation
